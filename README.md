# hello-world
I'm completely new to coding and this is my first step towards a career change!
Ever since dropping out of my advanced studies I've been searching for a job that will bring me satisfaction.
For 20 years it was one dead-end job after another.
Last month I finally decided to end the vicious cycle and commit (haha, get it?) myself to finally uprgrade my career, so I can not only provide for my family, but at the same time do something I've loved since my 11th birthday i.e. submerge myself in the world of Information Technology.
I am convinced I can make this change, even at 39 years old, and to prove that, I'll start learning code on my own and be the creator of my own future.
